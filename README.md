# NukeTools
My set of handy nuke tools and helpers

--Nuke Tools--
My nuke tools are designed to be copied straight into nuke, no installation required

--Python Scripts--
Most of my python scripts are intended to work standalone within nuke.
However since it proves to be slow to open them up in the script editor, 
I prefer to have a nuke menu autopopulated with all the scripts within a folder.
